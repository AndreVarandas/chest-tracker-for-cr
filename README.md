# chest-tracker-for-cr

⚔️ A simple app that tracks your next chests (Clash Royale)

## What is this?

This is a simple app that tracks your next chests for Clash Royale mobile game. It's a simple app that I made for my own use, but then I decided to publish it on the Google Playstore.

I thought we could rebuild it during this hacktoberfest in a cleaner and more complete version using [expo.io](expo.io) - so I am opening this repo for contributions.

After the hacktoberfest, I will publish the app on the Google Playstore again.

## How to run the project?

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Scan the QR code with the Expo app on your phone
